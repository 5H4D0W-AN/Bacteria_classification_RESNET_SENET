Preprocessed Raman spectroscopy data to enhance its quality and extract relevant spectral features for precise
bacteriaclassification.
Used Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs), including Residual Network and Squeeze and ExcitationNetworks, for
better precise bacteria classification using Raman spectroscopy data.
